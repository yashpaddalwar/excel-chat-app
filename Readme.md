## ‚ú® Features

*   **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions about your data in plain English.
*   **Multiple LLM Providers**: Choose from a variety of LLM providers, including Groq, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Together AI.
*   **Multiple File Upload**: Upload and analyze multiple Excel files at once.
*   **Data Summary**: Get a comprehensive summary of your data, including column statistics and data types.
*   **Code Generation**: The assistant generates Python code to perform data analysis, which you can inspect.
*   **Error Handling and Retry**: The system can automatically retry and fix code generation errors.
*   **Chat History Export**: Export your chat history for future reference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Core Language**: Python
*   **Web Framework**: Streamlit
*   **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
*   **LLM Framework**: LangChain
*   **Agent/Workflow Engine**: LangGraph
*   **LLM Providers**: Groq, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Together AI
*   **Package Management**: uv

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture that separates the user interface, data handling, and core logic.

*   **Streamlit UI**: The user interface is built with Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive web-based experience.
*   **Data Manager**: The `DataManager` class is responsible for loading, processing, and managing the Excel data using the pandas library.
*   **LLM Setup**: The `llm_setup` module handles the initialization of the language model from the selected provider.
*   **Chat Workflow (LangGraph)**: The core logic is powered by a state machine built with LangGraph. This workflow manages the entire chat process, from understanding the user's query to generating and executing code, and finally providing an answer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

The application follows a structured workflow to answer your questions:

1.  **Initialization**: The Streamlit application initializes the session state and sets up the UI.
2.  **LLM Configuration**: You select an LLM provider and enter your API key to initialize the language model.
3.  **File Upload**: You upload one or more Excel files, which are loaded into pandas DataFrames by the `DataManager`.
4.  **Data Summary**: A summary is generated for each DataFrame, giving you an overview of your data.
5.  **Chat Interaction**: You ask a question in the chat.
6.  **LangGraph Workflow**: Your query is processed by the LangGraph state machine:
    *   **Query Validity Check**: The system first checks if your query is relevant to the loaded data.
    *   **Code Generation**: If the query is valid, the LLM generates Python code to analyze the data.
    *   **Code Execution**: The generated code is executed in a safe environment.
    *   **Retry Mechanism**: If there's an error in the code, the system attempts to fix it and re-execute.
    *   **Answer Generation**: Based on the execution result, the LLM generates a user-friendly answer.
    *   **Clarification**: If the system can't resolve an error, it will ask you for clarification.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run the Excel Chat Assistant locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.13 or higher
*   `uv` for package installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashpaddalwar/excel-chat-app.git
cd excel-chat-app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

This project uses `uv` for package management.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
uv add requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up API Keys

The application requires an API key for the LLM provider you choose. You will be prompted to enter the API key in the application's sidebar.

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser.

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Configure LLM**: In the sidebar, select your preferred LLM provider and enter your API key. Click "Initialize LLM".
2.  **Upload Files**: Upload one or more Excel files using the file uploader in the sidebar.
3.  **Load Files**: Click the "Load Files" button to process the uploaded files.
4.  **Chat**: Once the files are loaded, you can start asking questions about your data in the chat input box.

##  walkthrough

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure and key files:

*   **`app.py`**: The main entry point of the Streamlit application. It initializes the session state and sets up the UI.
*   **`excel_chat_app/`**: The main application package.
    *   **`ui/`**: Contains the Streamlit UI components.
        *   `sidebar.py`: Defines the sidebar layout and functionality.
        *   `main_content.py`: Defines the main content area, including the chat interface.
    *   **`core/`**: Contains the core application logic.
        *   `data_handler.py`: The `DataManager` class for handling Excel data.
        *   `llm_setup.py`: The `setup_llm` function for initializing the language model.
        *   `chat_workflow.py`: The `ChatWorkflow` class, which defines the LangGraph state machine for the chat logic.
